## What is Machine learning ? 

- Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data.
- It involves building models that can identify patterns and make predictions without being explicitly programmed.
- There are three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
- Supervised learning uses labeled data, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning involves interaction with an environment.
- Machine learning is used in various applications Classification and Regression 
- Classification involves predicting a categorical label or class for a given input.Examples include classifying emails as spam or not spam, identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog, or predicting customer churn (e.g., stay or leave).
- Regression, on the other hand, involves predicting a continuous numerical value.Examples include predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location, forecasting stock prices, or estimating the temperature based on weather data.




## Supervised Learning

- In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data, where each input data point is associated with a corresponding target label or output.
- The goal is to learn a mapping or relationship between the input features and the target labels, such as predicting a label for new, unseen data.
- Examples include classification (predicting discrete labels) and regression (predicting continuous values).
- Supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled data for training.

## Unsupervised Learning

- In unsupervised learning, the model learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data without explicit supervision.
- The goal is to discover hidden patterns or representations within the data, such as clustering similar data points together or reducing the dimensionality of the data.
- Examples include clustering (grouping similar data points), dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of input features), and density estimation (estimating the probability density function of the data).
- Unsupervised learning is useful for exploratory data analysis and understanding the underlying structure of the data.

## Semi-Supervised Learning

- Semi-supervised learning lies between supervised and unsupervised learning and utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data during training.
- The model learns from a small amount of labeled data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data.
- The goal is to improve the performance of supervised learning models by leveraging the additional unlabeled data, which may be more readily available.
- Semi-supervised learning methods often involve combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, such as self-training or co-training.

![Semi-Supervised Learning](images/semi-supervised.png)


## Self-Supervised Learning

- In self-supervised learning, the model learns from the inherent structure of the input data itself, without relying on external labels.
- The model is trained on pretext tasks where the labels are generated from the input data, such as predicting missing parts of the input or solving puzzles.
- The learned representations can then be used for downstream tasks, similar to supervised learning.
- Self-supervised learning is advantageous when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, as it allows the model to learn from large amounts of unlabeled data.

![Self-Supervised Learning](images/self-supervised.png)


A self-supervised learning model is a type of machine learning model that learns representations from unlabeled data without explicit supervision. Instead of relying on labeled data, which is typical in supervised learning, self-supervised learning models generate labels from the input data itself.

Key characteristics of self-supervised learning models include:

- Unlabeled Data: These models are trained on large amounts of unlabeled data, where the input data itself serves as the source for generating labels or targets for training.
- Pretext Tasks: Self-supervised learning models are trained on pretext tasks, where the model predicts certain properties or transformations of the input data. These tasks are designed to encourage the model to learn meaningful representations of the data.
- Representation Learning: By learning to predict these pretext tasks, the model implicitly learns to extract useful features or representations of the data, which can then be used for downstream tasks.
- Transfer Learning: The learned representations from self-supervised learning can be transferred and fine-tuned for various downstream tasks, such as classification, regression, or clustering, often leading to improved performance, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.

Self-supervised learning has gained popularity due to its ability to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, which is often more readily available than labeled data. It has been successful in various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition, among others.

# 1. Decision Trees 

Resource - https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/08/decision-tree-algorithm/


A decision tree - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcI5E2Ng6r4&ab_channel=IntuitiveMachineLearning


A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm for that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.Decision tree algorithm is a tree-like structured classifier preferably used to solve classification and regression problems.When a decision tree classifies the values into separate categories it is called classification tree. When it predicts continuous values/numerical values it is called regression tree.

It consists of nodes divided into three categories:

- **Root Node:** The initial node at the beginning of a decision tree, where the entire population or dataset starts dividing based on various features or conditions.

- **Decision Nodes:** Nodes resulting from the splitting of root nodes are known as decision nodes. These nodes represent intermediate decisions or conditions within the tree. Each decision node represents the possible solution to the problems.

- **Leaf Nodes:** Nodes where further splitting is not possible, often indicating the final classification or outcome. Leaf nodes are also referred to as terminal nodes. It is the actual output of the class label. There is no further classification of leaf node.

It goes from root node to leaf node. But it becomes quite complicated to select the best attribute for the root node & the sub nodes. We use election techniques to solve the problem. The values are sorted and the value having a higher value is taken at the root node.

The few attribute election techniques are:

- **Entropy** - Which is the measure of randomness in the information being processed.
- **Information Gain** - It shows the difference between the entropy of the root node and the weighted average entropy of the decision & leaf nodes.
- **Ginni Index** - measure of the purity and impurity while creating a decision tree.

![Alt text](<images/Screenshot 2024-02-22 at 17.45.58.png>)

1. **Root Node**: The initial node at the beginning of a decision tree, where the entire population or dataset starts dividing based on various features or conditions.

2. **Decision Nodes**: Nodes resulting from the splitting of root nodes are known as decision nodes. These nodes represent intermediate decisions or conditions within the tree.

3. **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes where further splitting is not possible, often indicating the final classification or outcome. Leaf nodes are also referred to as terminal nodes.

4. **Sub-Tree**: Similar to a subsection of a graph being called a sub-graph, a sub-section of a decision tree is referred to as a sub-tree. It represents a specific portion of the decision tree.

5. **Pruning**: The process of removing or cutting down specific nodes in a decision tree to prevent overfitting and simplify the model.

6. **Branch / Sub-Tree**: A subsection of the entire decision tree is referred to as a branch or sub-tree. It represents a specific path of decisions and outcomes within the tree.

7. **Parent and Child Node**: In a decision tree, a node that is divided into sub-nodes is known as a parent node, and the sub-nodes emerging from it are referred to as child nodes. The parent node represents a decision or condition, while the child nodes represent the potential outcomes or further decisions based on that condition.

### Learning Process:
The learning process of a decision tree involves finding the optimal splits for partitioning the data at each node. This is typically done using a criterion such as Gini impurity or information gain for classification tasks, or mean squared error for regression tasks.

* Gini Impurity: Measures the probability of incorrectly classifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the class distribution in the node.

* Information Gain: Measures the reduction in entropy or uncertainty achieved by splitting the data based on a specific feature

An attribute with a low Gini index is preferred over the high Gini index.


### Advantages of Decision Trees

- **Relatively Easy to Interpret:** Decision trees provide a straightforward and intuitive representation of decision-making processes, making them easy to understand for non-experts.

- **Robust to Outliers:** Decision trees are robust to outliers in the data, as they partition the feature space based on splitting criteria rather than relying on the absolute values of data points.

- **Can Deal with Missing Values:** Decision trees can handle missing values in the dataset by using surrogate splits, which allow them to still make decisions even when certain feature values are missing.

- **Non-Linear:** Decision trees are capable of capturing non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, allowing them to model complex decision boundaries.

- **Non-Parametric:** Decision trees do not make assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, making them flexible and suitable for a wide range of data distributions.

- **Combining Features to Make Predictions:** Decision trees can combine multiple features to make predictions, allowing them to capture interactions between different features in the data.

- **Can Deal with Categorical Values:** Decision trees naturally handle categorical values without the need for one-hot encoding or other preprocessing techniques.

- **Minimal Data Preparation:** Decision trees require minimal data preprocessing compared to some other machine learning algorithms, as they can handle mixed data types and do not require scaling or normalization of features.

### Disadvantages of Decision Trees

- **Overfitting:** Decision trees are prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees and complex data, which can lead to poor generalization performance on unseen data.

- **Instability due to High Variance:** Small variations in the data can lead to different tree structures, making decision trees unstable.

- **Bias towards Features with Many Levels:** Features with many levels are favored in the construction of decision trees, which can lead to biased splits and potentially overlook important but less represented features.

- **Limited Expressiveness:** Decision trees may not capture complex relationships between features in the data, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks with intricate patterns.



### How it works with an Example? 

Suppose we have a dataset of animals with features like whether they have feathers, lay eggs, and can fly. We also have the target variable indicating whether the animal is a bird or not. Here's a small portion of our dataset:

| Feathers | Lay Eggs | Can Fly | Is Bird? |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| Yes      | Yes      | Yes     | Yes      |
| Yes      | Yes      | No      | No       |
| No       | Yes      | No      | No       |
| Yes      | No       | Yes     | Yes      |
| No       | Yes      | No      | No       |
| No       | No       | No      | No       |
| Yes      | Yes      | Yes     | Yes      |
| Yes      | Yes      | Yes     | Yes      |

We want to build a decision tree to predict whether an animal is a bird based on its features.

1. **Root Node**: We start by choosing the best feature to split the dataset at the root node. We use a metric like Information Gain to evaluate the effectiveness of each feature. Let's say we choose "Can Fly" as the root node because it has the highest Information Gain.

2. **Decision Nodes**: The "Can Fly" node splits the dataset into two branches: animals that can fly and animals that cannot. Each branch leads to a decision node.

3. **Leaf Nodes**: At the decision nodes, we continue splitting the dataset based on other features. For example, the branch with animals that can fly might further split based on whether they have feathers. This process continues until we reach leaf nodes where no further splitting is possible.

The decision tree might look like this:

```
        Can Fly?
       /         \
  Yes /           \ No
     /             \
 Feathers?         No
  /    \
 Yes   No
  |     |
 Bird   Not Bird
```
Now, if we want to classify a new animal, we start at the root node and follow the branches based on its features. For example, if the animal has feathers, does not lay eggs, and cannot fly, we would classify it as "Not Bird" based on the decision tree.

This is a simplified example, but it illustrates the basic concept of how decision trees work by recursively splitting the dataset based on features to make predictions.


# 2. Random Forest

Random Forest is a popular ensemble learning method used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. It is an extension of decision trees and operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during the training phase and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

![Alt text](<images/randomforest.png>)

![Alt text](<images/Randomforest.png>)


### How Random Forest Works:

1. **Random Sampling with Replacement (Bootstrap Aggregating or Bagging):**
   - Random Forest builds multiple decision trees by randomly sampling the training data with replacement. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the data.

2. **Random Feature Selection:**
   - At each node of the decision tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This introduces randomness and decorrelation between the individual trees.

3. **Tree Building:**
   - Each decision tree in the Random Forest is constructed using a subset of the training data and a subset of features at each node.
   - The decision trees are grown to their maximum depth or until a minimum number of samples per leaf node is reached.

4. **Voting (Classification) or Averaging (Regression):**
   - For classification tasks, the class that receives the most votes from the individual trees is selected as the predicted class.
   - For regression tasks, the average prediction from all the individual trees is taken as the final prediction.

### Advantages of Random Forest:

1. **High Accuracy:**
   - Random Forest generally provides higher accuracy compared to single decision trees, especially for complex datasets.

2. **Robustness to Overfitting:**
   - By averaging multiple decision trees, Random Forest is less prone to overfitting than individual decision trees.

3. **Implicit Feature Selection:**
   - Random Forest naturally performs feature selection by evaluating the importance of different features based on their contribution to the performance of the trees.

4. **Handling Missing Values and Outliers:**
   - Random Forest can handle missing values and outliers in the dataset without requiring preprocessing.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Random Forest is parallelizable and can efficiently handle large datasets.

### Disadvantages of Random Forest:

1. **Lack of Interpretability:**
   - Random Forest models can be difficult to interpret compared to individual decision trees.

2. **Computationally Expensive:**
   - Training multiple decision trees and aggregating their predictions can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.

3. **Memory Consumption:**
   - Random Forest models can consume a significant amount of memory, particularly when dealing with a large number of trees or features.

4. **Less Effective on Noisy Data:**
   - Random Forest may not perform well on noisy data with a large number of irrelevant features, as it may include irrelevant features in the tree construction process.

# Difference between Decision trees & Random Forest ? 

| Decision trees                                             | Random Forest                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decision trees normally suffer from the problem of overfitting if it’s allowed to grow without any control. | Random forests are created from subsets of data, and the final output is based on average or majority ranking; hence the problem of overfitting is taken care of. |
| A single decision tree is faster in computation.           | It is comparatively slower.                                 |
| When a data set with features is taken as input by a decision tree, it will formulate some rules to make predictions. | Random forest randomly selects observations, builds a decision tree, and takes the average result. It doesn’t use any set of formulas. |


# 3. XGBoost

XGBoost, short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is an optimized and efficient implementation of the gradient boosting machine learning algorithm. It is widely used in machine learning competitions and real-world applications due to its high performance and scalability. XGBoost is designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and customizable, making it suitable for a wide range of tasks, including classification, regression, and ranking problems.

![Alt text](<images/xgboost.png>)

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that utilizes the gradient boosting framework for supervised learning tasks, primarily regression and classification. It is an extension of the traditional gradient boosting algorithm with enhanced efficiency and performance.

Bootstrapping

- Bootstrapping is a resampling technique where multiple subsets of the original dataset are created by randomly sampling with replacement.
- In the context of XGBoost, bootstrapping is used during the training process to generate diverse subsets of the training data for each individual tree in the ensemble.
- Each subset, also known as a bootstrap sample, contains a random selection of data points from the original dataset, potentially including duplicates of certain observations due to sampling with replacement.

Aggregating

- Aggregating refers to the process of combining the predictions of multiple individual models (trees in the case of XGBoost) to make a final prediction.
- In XGBoost, each individual tree learns to predict the target variable based on a subset of the training data. These individual predictions are aggregated to produce the final ensemble prediction.
- Aggregating the predictions of multiple trees helps to improve the overall predictive performance of the model by reducing variance and enhancing generalization.

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

- Bagging is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines the concepts of bootstrapping and aggregating.
- In XGBoost, bagging is achieved through the use of multiple decision trees, each trained on a different bootstrap sample of the original dataset.
- Bagging helps to reduce overfitting by introducing diversity among the individual trees in the ensemble, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
- By aggregating the predictions of multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data, bagging produces a more robust and accurate predictive model compared to a single decision tree.

In summary, XGBoost utilizes bootstrapping to generate diverse subsets of the training data, aggregates the predictions of multiple individual trees, and employs bagging to combine the concepts of bootstrapping and aggregating to improve the overall predictive performance of the model.

Overall, XGBoost is a powerful and versatile algorithm that excels in various machine learning tasks, particularly when dealing with structured/tabular data, and it is widely adopted in both research and industry settings.



# 4. Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Despite its name, logistic regression is actually a classification algorithm, commonly used for binary classification tasks, where the target variable has two possible outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1, true or false, yes or no).

### How Logistic Regression Works:

1. **Model Representation:**
   - In logistic regression, the dependent variable \( y \) is binary (0 or 1). The goal is to model the probability that \( y \) belongs to a particular class given the values of independent variables \( X \).

2. **Sigmoid Function:**
   - Logistic regression uses the sigmoid function (also known as the logistic function) to model the probability of the dependent variable belonging to the positive class:
   \[ P(y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]
   where \( z \) is the linear combination of the independent variables and their corresponding coefficients: \( z = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n \).

3. **Probability Threshold:**
   - By default, logistic regression predicts the class with a probability threshold of 0.5. If the predicted probability is greater than or equal to 0.5, the model predicts class 1; otherwise, it predicts class 0.

4. **Training:**
   - Logistic regression is trained using an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent, which minimizes a cost function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) to find the optimal coefficients \( \beta \) that maximize the likelihood of the observed data.

5. **Prediction:**
   - Once trained, the logistic regression model can predict the probability of an observation belonging to the positive class (class 1) based on its input features. The predicted probability can then be converted into a binary prediction using the probability threshold.

### Advantages & disadvantages of Logistic Regression:

| Logistic regression can be easily scaled to handle multi-class classification problems using techniques such as one-vs-rest or multinomial logistic regression. | Logistic regression is limited to binary classification tasks and may not be suitable for multi-class classification problems without modification. |
| Probabilistic Outputs:                                              | Sensitive to Outliers:                                               |
| Logistic regression provides probabilistic outputs, allowing for a probabilistic interpretation of predictions. | Logistic regression is sensitive to outliers in the dataset, which can influence the estimated coefficients and predictions. |


Overall, logistic regression is a widely used and effective algorithm for binary classification tasks, especially when interpretability and efficiency are important considerations. However, it may not be suitable for tasks with complex nonlinear relationships or multi-class classification problems.

# 5. Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous target variables based on one or more independent variables.

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

The general form of a linear regression model with one independent variable is \( y = mx + b \), where \( y \) is the dependent variable, \( x \) is the independent variable, \( m \) is the slope of the line, and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in the case of multiple independent variables) that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the linear model.

The linear regression model estimates the values of the slope \( m \) and the y-intercept \( b \) based on the observed data points. This is often done using the method of least squares.

Linear regression is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, engineering, and social sciences for tasks such as predicting house prices, analyzing the relationship between variables, and understanding the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable.

It is also the foundation for more complex regression techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Objective:
- Minimize the difference between actual and predicted values by finding the best-fitting line.

Output:
- Coefficients: Slope(s) and intercept(s) for each feature.
- Predictions: Estimated values for the target variable based on input features.

Output:

y=mx+b
m - slope/coefficients
b - intercept
Coefficients: Slope(s) and intercept(s) for each feature.
Predictions: Estimated values for the target variable based on input features.

Evaluation:
Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared.
Assessing Fit: Plotting actual vs. predicted values, residual plots.

# what does coefficients tell us Linear regression output machine learning?
Coefficients in linear regression output indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between independent variables and the target variable.
They represent the change in the target variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant.
Positive coefficients suggest a positive correlation, meaning an increase in the independent variable leads to an increase in the target variable.
Negative coefficients suggest a negative correlation, meaning an increase in the independent variable leads to a decrease in the target variable.
Coefficients can be interpreted to understand the relative importance of different features in predicting the target variable.
They are essential for making predictions using the linear regression model.

# 6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It is particularly effective for classification tasks in high-dimensional spaces and cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

![Alt text](<images/svm.png>)

### How SVM Works:

1. **Margin Maximization:**
   - SVM aims to find the hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space while maximizing the margin between the classes. The hyperplane is the decision boundary that separates the data points belonging to different classes.

2. **Support Vectors:**
   - Support vectors are the data points closest to the hyperplane and are crucial for defining the decision boundary. These points determine the margin and the orientation of the hyperplane.

3. **Kernel Trick:**
   - SVM can efficiently handle non-linear decision boundaries in the feature space by using the kernel trick. This involves mapping the original input space into a higher-dimensional space where the classes are linearly separable.

4. **Soft Margin SVM:**
   - In cases where the data is not perfectly separable, SVM allows for the introduction of a penalty term (C parameter) to control the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error.

### Advantages & disadvantage of SVM:

* Coefficients in linear regression output indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between independent variables and the target variable.
* They represent the change in the target variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant.
* Positive coefficients suggest a positive correlation, meaning an increase in the independent variable leads to an increase in the target variable.
* Negative coefficients suggest a negative correlation, meaning an increase in the independent variable leads to a decrease in the target variable.
* Coefficients can be interpreted to understand the relative importance of different features in predicting the target variable.
* They are essential for making predictions using the linear regression model.
