Here's a concise explanation of the differences between supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and self-supervised learning:

**Supervised Learning:**

- **Definition:** In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each example in the training set is paired with a corresponding target label.
- **Objective:** The objective is to learn a mapping from input variables to output variables based on the labeled dataset.
- **Examples:** Classification (predicting categories), Regression (predicting continuous values).

**Unsupervised Learning:**

- **Definition:** In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns patterns from unlabeled data without any explicit feedback.
- **Objective:** The objective is to discover hidden structures or patterns in the data, such as clustering similar data points or dimensionality reduction.
- **Examples:** Clustering (grouping similar data points), Dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of input variables).

**Semi-Supervised Learning:**

- **Definition:** Semi-supervised learning combines elements of supervised and unsupervised learning, using both labeled and unlabeled data for training.
- **Objective:** The objective is to improve learning performance by leveraging the additional information provided by unlabeled data, which is often more abundant than labeled data.
- **Examples:** Using a small labeled dataset along with a large unlabeled dataset for training a model.

**Self-Supervised Learning:**

- **Definition:** Self-supervised learning is a type of supervised learning where the supervision signal is automatically generated from the input data itself, without requiring external labels.
- **Objective:** The objective is to design tasks that generate labels or targets from the input data, such as predicting missing parts of the input or generating pretext tasks.

- **Examples:** Predicting missing words in a sentence (masked language modeling), Image inpainting (predicting missing parts of an image).

In summary, supervised learning uses labeled data with explicit feedback, unsupervised learning operates on unlabeled data to discover patterns, semi-supervised learning leverages both labeled and unlabeled data, and self-supervised learning generates its own labels from the input data itself.
