# Google Vision OCR API service (Optical Character Recognition)

The Vision API can detect and extract text from images. There are two annotation features that support optical character recognition (OCR):

1. **TEXT_DETECTION:** Detects and extracts text from any image. For example, a photograph might contain a street sign or traffic sign. The JSON includes the entire extracted string, as well as individual words, and their bounding boxes.

2. **DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION:** Also extracts text from an image, but the response is optimized for dense text and documents. The JSON includes page, block, paragraph, word, and break information.

   - Use DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION for handwriting extraction and text extraction from files (PDF/TIFF).

# AutoML Tables Overview

AutoML Tables is a supervised machine learning service provided by Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This service is designed to build and deploy advanced machine learning models using tabular data. It operates at a significantly increased speed and scale and is an extension of GCP's core AutoML platform.

## Key Features

- Abstraction of custom model building tasks (e.g., feature engineering, hyper-parameter tuning, model selection)
- Automated model building using relevant tabular data
- UI-driven, no-code approach for model deployment as REST-based scalable microservices

## Example Usage

Consider a scenario where a house sales dataset is used to predict house prices. The dataset includes features in columns 1 to 6, and the final price is in the "final_price" column.

AutoML Tables can be configured to automatically build a classification model based on this dataset, predicting house prices without manual intervention in tasks like data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection.

## AutoML Tables Capabilities

Contrary to a common misconception, AutoML Tables supports various data types beyond numerical values, such as timestamps, long text descriptions, and arrays. In our example, we'll use long text descriptions to build a classification model.

## Problem Statement and Solution

**Problem:** A company receives electronics inventory data from multiple vendors with complex long text product descriptions. Each item needs accurate classification for downstream processes like planning, forecasting, and billing.

**Challenges:**
1. Limited data science resources for custom model builds per vendor.
2. Slow custom build cycle affecting speed to onboard new vendors.
3. Low accuracy of the model across all vendors.

## AutoML Tables Benefits

1. **Cost:** No-code platform, eliminating the need for extensive data science skills.
2. **Speed:** Models can be created in hours to days, compared to months with custom models.
3. **Scale:** Configurable for automatic scaling with new vendor enrolments through MLOps pipelines.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Creating AutoML Tables Dataset

1. Navigate to GCP Console → Vertex AI → Datasets → Create dataset.
2. Provide a name for the dataset, select Tabular as the data type, and choose Classification as the Objective.
3. Select the region and click Create.

### Step 6: Batch Predictions

1. AutoML Tables supports batch predictions for running model predictions on a batch of input datasets.

## Outcome

Using GCP AutoML Tables, a Classification model covering all vendors was built and delivered within days, achieving an accuracy of 98% without additional costs.

## Conclusion

Google Cloud AutoML Tables offers a powerful machine learning platform for structured data, combining speed, scale, and accuracy. While it may not be a one-stop solution for every ML need, its capabilities make it a valuable tool when appropriately qualified.
