Document classification is the process of categorizing scanned or digitized document images into predefined categories based on their content or layout.

- Helpful in cases of MultiPage PDFs
- Improved accuracy
- Faster processing
- Better organization

Here are some key characteristics of the LayoutLMv2 model for document classification:

- It is a transformer-based model that is pre-trained on large datasets of documents to understand document structure and layout. This includes things like sections, paragraphs, tables, lists, etc.

- It uses an additional vector called the 2D position embedding to encode the x and y coordinates of layout elements in the input documents. This allows the model to understand the positional relationships between elements.

- The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several document image classification benchmarks, outperforming previous layout-aware models like LayoutLM.

- It is particularly effective at classifying documents that have a structured layout with multiple sections, images, titles, etc. The layout encoding helps it understand the hierarchical relationships.

- The self-supervised pre-training allows LayoutLMv2 to generalize to classify new document types without requiring large amounts of labeled training data.

- It incorporates visual structures like paragraphs and tables when making its document classifications, allowing for a holistic interpretation of the document.

- Overall, the layout and vision capabilities allow more accurate classification of real-world documents compared to previous text-only or layout-agnostic methods.

In summary, LayoutLMv2 pushes state-of-the-art performance for document classification while incorporating an understanding of document structure and layout in its predictions.

### Dataset Organization Instructions
1. Convert the PDF into images and organize them into their respective classes.
2. Create a folder named "dataset."
3. Inside "dataset," create two subfolders named "PassiveInvoice" and "CMR."
4. Place the corresponding images into their respective subfolders.

### Dataset Balancing
Make sure to balance the dataset for each of the classes if possible. If balancing is not possible, the `train_test_split` parameter `stratify=data['label']` ensures the same class distribution in both the training and testing sets.

### OCR Engine
`LayoutLMv2Processor` uses PyTesseract, a Python wrapper around Googleâ€™s Tesseract OCR engine, under the hood. Note that you can still use your own OCR engine of choice and provide the words and normalized boxes. This requires initializing `LayoutLMv2ImageProcessor` with `apply_ocr` set to False.
