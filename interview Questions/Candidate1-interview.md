### Statistics 

1. Explain me what is Random Variables ? 
2. Difference between discrete & Random Variables?
3. There are two random variables what does it mean they are independent?
4. There are two random variables? How to calculate the probability of intersection of events ?
5. What is the formula for Conditional Probablity ?
5. What is the method of Reducing the number of variables ? PCA (Principal component Analysis ) /SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
5. Explain Principal component Analysis ? 
6. How to sort Eigen values?
7. For n variables how many eigenvalues we will get ? 
8. why do we choose first k, instead of last k eigenvalues? 


### Machine Learning
1. What are the technques in Linear Regression for reducing dimensionality?
2. What is Regularization & Why do we use it ?
3. How L1 and L2 Regularization works ? 
3. What is Ridge Regression ? 
4. Why Overfitting happens in Machine Learning & Neural Networks? 
5. Difference between decision Tree vs RandomForest?
6. Overfitting happens in Random forest vs decision tree?
7. What is voting system in Random Forest in classification & Regression? 


### Neural Network
1. What are the two big problems while training a neural network?
2. Explain Vanishing Gradient problem in Machine Learning?
3. Another big problem while minimizing the loss function we minimize the loss function. How many minimum does it have ? 
4. What is learning Rate in Neural Network?
5. What is Adam optmizers in Neural Network?
6. What does Adam does with learning Rate in Neural Network?
7. We have a layer that takes 16 inputs , 4 outputs for dense layers , How many parameters does bias have? 
8. What is convolution layer ? 
9. In convolution layer there are 16 inputs, a kernel for each subregion of 4 neurons, how many parameters does it have ? 


### Dynamic Programming 
1. What is dynamic programming ? Some examples of application?
2. When we can apply dynamic programming & What are the characteristics of dynamic programming?


### Finance 
1. What is portfolio mananagement We have different asserts how do we calculate the risk of portfolio?
2. We have 2 asserts to choose for the portfolio mananagement. We know the risk of a & b . Are we able to always minimize the risk of portfolio?
3. if 2 assets basically grow andfall together, can we reduce the risk
