Hello, Good afternoon! My name is Jyoti Yadav. I am from India. I have a total of 4 years of work experience in India as a software engineer & Almost close to 2 years of work experience as a Data Scientist.I completed my bachelor's degree in 2016 in Electronics & Communications Engineering from India.


### HPE (Hewlett Packard Enterprise)

Soon after my Bachelors Degree, I joined HPE as a Graduate Software Engineer. During my tenure, I focused on Python development & automation testing including functional testing, I also worked on test plan documentation, analyzing requirements, and identifying and logging defects.

- Creating scripts to automate routine test cases and workflows.
- Test planning Identify test scenarios, define test objectives, and prioritize testing activities based on project goals and timelines. Writing derived test cases.
- Executed functional and regression testing.
- Participated in defect review meetings.
- Communicated with offshore and onshore teams.
- Prepared status reports and demonstrated test deliverables.


### DXC Technology

After the merger with CSC, the company became DXC Technology. I transitioned to a different team and started working with the automation team. I gained experience in automation testing using Selenium Webdriver, using the programming language Python, and Java, along with frameworks such as Maven, TestNG, and Jenkins.

- I created frameworks fro Regression testing from scratch using Selenium Webdriver & Python. 
- Fixed failed jobs in Jenkins and debugged automation test scripts.
- Reduced testing time for regression cases by 40%.
- Rest API testing using POSTMAN, 
_ Automation tool using TOSCA test suite

### GlobalLogic

I focused on mobile testing for both Android and iOS devices, dealing with in-app messages, push notifications, and SMS. 

- Developed a framework for mobile testing regression cases using Appium Framework & Executing the test cases.
- Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that tests are executed automatically during the build and deployment process.
- Monitoring & Fixing failed jobs in in jenkins 
- Attending daily Scrum calls with clients and reporting the status.

## Transition in ML/AI

I was voluntarily also participating in hackathons and POCs. I worked on predictive modeling.I worked on mostly the classification and Regression problems to be applied using supervised learning techniques. 

One of the project 
Defect prediction: By analyzing historical defect data, ML algorithms can predict the likelihood of defects in specific areas of the software, allowing testers to focus their efforts on high-risk areas.

AI and ML models can evaluate historical defect data, code complexity and vulnerabilities, and other relevant criteria to identify possible issues in current software releases. These predictions may be used by testers to proactively target certain areas for testing, minimizing the risk of defects reaching production.

Second project
Disease prediction using AI/ML - Binary classification problem using Logistic regression with F1 score of 70-75 %. 

The experience in POCs fascinated me, leading me to pursue a master's in Artificial Intelligence.
During my academic period, I worked on projects and internships, including one at Proceedit in Barcelona, where I worked on sentiment analysis for stocks and deployed the model in AWS using Flask.

I have used pytorch programming langauge. 


Then I got another opportunity to work with Wenda SRLin Bologna in April 2022. Wenda SRL is a startup in Bologna specializing.
They initially stated as a food tech company and later they specialized themselfs in the supply chain domain.
For my thesis, I worked on the topic of "Extraction of specific entities from Unstructured documents" in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

Project1: Development of Agents using LangChain:
* Role: Spearheaded development and deployment of a versatile agent for the marketing team.
The agent's purpose was to do copywriting for the marketing team for maximum personalization We also provided additional information from the APIs for the restaurants. There were different use cases
1. Provided the title of the dish the agent needs to extract other information like : Ingredients, descriptions,Allergens & additional information
2. Given an image & title of the image the agent has to write the 4 posts for social media
3. Given an goal (advertising ) & Interest (age - 18-69, Facebook interest: It has to generate the 
4. Similarly given an object of the campaign like promotions or offers. It has to write the campaign name, campaign object & campaign email. 
Later on The agent deployed using the fast API, docker, docker-compose.yaml on the Google cloud platform. 


Technologies Used:
* Open-source tools: Wikipedia, DuckDuckGoSearch, Serper API.
* Advanced models: Llama-3, Mistral 8×7B, Mistral 7B.

Data pipeline technologies: AWS, Apache Airflow, Celery, Redshift, Glue, Athena.
* At first we utilise the model from ChatGroQ which provides faster access to the open source LLM model Which provides the faster AI Inference. 
* Incorporated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
* ReAct - The agent combine both the reasoning , thought and action (chain of thoughts ) before taking any steps 
https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react
* Optimized response accuracy and relevance through meticulous prompt engineering.
* Fine-tuned advanced models to enhance the agent’s capabilities.
* Data Management: Constructed an end-to-end data pipeline for seamless data management and processing.


Proejct2: Document Classification and Information Extraction from documents:
Model Development:
* Developed a model to classify pages within PDF documents and extract information.
* Used Multi-modal transformers to fine-tune the model on the custom datasets. Utilized to combine images and spatial information (text and bounding boxes).
* Showcased the model on Hugging Face with Gradio.
Technologies Used:
* OCR Tools: Tesseract, PaddleOCR, Keras-OCR, Amazon Textract, Google Vision.
Performance:
* Achieved an F1 score of approximately 94%.
* Model capable of classifying pages and extracting information.
Additionally, Dataset preparation was a huge problem for us at the beginning. So we create a semi-automatic tool which helps us to prepare a larger base of dataset. So basically the model was trained with close to 20 documents and we used the same model to do predictions on other documents. After predictions we did a manual review for the documents correctly annotated.


Project3: Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Dataset Annotation:
* NLP Models Applied: BERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, Deberta.
Research and Comparative Performance:
* Fine-tuned and deployed LLM models such as Llama 2, Mixtral 8×7B, Gemma, and Vicuna using RAG and PEFT techniques.
