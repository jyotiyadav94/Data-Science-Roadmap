# 1. Dynamic Programming 

Dynamic Programming is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems. This article provides a detailed exploration of dynamic programming concepts, illustrated with examples.

How Does Dynamic Programming (DP) Work?

Identify Subproblems: Divide the main problem into smaller, independent subproblems.
Store Solutions: Solve each subproblem and store the solution in a table or array.
Build Up Solutions: Use the stored solutions to build up the solution to the main problem.
Avoid Redundancy: By storing solutions, DP ensures that each subproblem is solved only once, reducing computation time.
