# Knight problem


# Introduction

As this is an application for a Machine Learning Engineer position and not for a Data Scientist, skills related to the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project and, in general, to software engineering are important.
However, both roles, in their daily work, share the need to model problems and respond quickly with various possible solutions: this is the reason why the exercise, in the first part, does not involve machine learning.


## <a name="subjects"></a> Main topics and their sub topics

As previously stated, some degree of competence in the following topics is required:

* Python
* Machine Learning / Deep Learning (at least one of the following):
	* object detection;
	* object tracking;
	* time series anomaly detection;
	* tabular data classification;
	* reinforcement learning;
	* transformers.
* Systems:
	* AWS;
	* Docker / Docker Compose;
	* distributed architectures.
* Edge Computing.


## Part 1)

A knight is in a known cell on an empty chessboard and needs to reach another known cell.

Write a Python program that can take as input the two positions on the chessboard and returns as output:

* the set of all minimum-length sequences to move the piece from the initial cell to the final cell;
* a graphviz/dot file of the previous "all shortest path" graph.

Your code can use external libraries or you can avoid them as you wish. The case do not require machine learning specific algorithms or approaches.

Please provide also:

* a `requirements.txt`, if needed;
* a `Dockerfile` for the full environment, if you know how to create a `Dockerfile`;
* a short `README.md`.

In any case, please write a plain Python script avoiding Jupyter Notebooks.

Showing good programming practices such as care in linting and following standards are certainly appreciated.


## Part 2)

Write a short markdown file named `NOTES.md` which should contain a description in English on how you would extend you previous script, showing some knowledge of the previously listed [Main topics and their sub topics](#subjects).

You don't have to write something about every subject: choose a subset of them and be creative.

Trivial example: how could you create a good dataset to write a classifier for valid knight moves? Or how could you turn your script into a secure cloud service?

The more topics you can link together or the more creative you are in describing possible lines of research and development, the better. ðŸ˜ƒ

When you feel you have achieved a good result in the first and second parts of the exercise, I would ask you to please send all response files via email in a zip format, preferably within four working days.
Thank you for your time.
